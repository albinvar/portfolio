      "# How I Avoided NVR/DVR Setup Using My Pi5 and Backblaze B2\n\nTraditional Network Video Recorder (NVR) systems can be expensive, bulky, and often limited in functionality. After researching various surveillance options, I created a streamlined and cost-effective alternative using a Raspberry Pi 5 and Backblaze B2 cloud storage. This solution not only saved me hundreds of dollars but also provided greater flexibility and scalability than commercial options. Here's how I built my cloud-powered surveillance system.\n\n## Why I Needed an Alternative to Traditional NVR Systems\n\nTraditional surveillance setups typically require dedicated NVR hardware, which can be costly and inflexible. Many commercial systems also lock you into proprietary ecosystems, making future upgrades complicated and expensive. As someone who values both privacy and flexibility, I wanted a solution that would give me complete control while keeping costs reasonable.\n\nAfter evaluating my options, I determined that my requirements included:\n\n- Support for multiple IP cameras\n- Reliable 24/7 recording\n- Motion detection and notifications\n- Secure offsite storage for footage\n- Cost-effectiveness over the long term\n- Ability to access recordings remotely\n\nA Raspberry Pi 5 paired with cloud storage seemed like the perfect solution to meet these needs without breaking the bank.\n\n## Hardware Configuration\n\n### The Raspberry Pi 5 Setup\n\nThe Raspberry Pi 5 serves as the brain of the operation. Its improved processing power makes it significantly more capable than previous models for handling multiple camera streams. Here's what my hardware setup includes:\n\n- Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB RAM model)\n- NVMe SSD (1TB) for system and temporary storage\n- USB Coral TPU accelerator (for efficient object detection)\n- PoE HAT (optional, for powering the Pi directly from ethernet)\n\nThe Pi 5's robust CPU and increased RAM allow it to handle multiple camera streams while performing motion detection and other processing tasks. Using an NVMe drive rather than an SD card provides much better performance and reliability for continuous recording operations.\n\n### Cameras\n\nI use a mix of PoE and Wi-Fi cameras, including:\n\n- 2x Hikvision DS-2CD2122FW-I (1080p PoE cameras)\n- 1x Reolink C800 (4K camera with H.265 support)\n\nThese cameras provide a good balance of quality, reliability, and cost. Each camera supports RTSP streams, which is essential for integration with our software stack.\n\n## Software Configuration\n\n### Operating System and Base Configuration\n\nI started with a fresh install of Raspberry Pi OS and configured it for headless operation. For this project, I utilized Jeff Geerling's open-source pi-nvr project, which provides Ansible automation for NVR software installation.\n\n``````\n\n### Frigate NVR Software\n\nFrigate is an excellent open-source NVR solution that works well on the Raspberry Pi. It provides robust motion detection, object recognition (especially when paired with a Coral TPU), and flexible storage options.\n\nMy `config.yml` file for Frigate looks something like this:\n\n``````\n\n## Cloud Storage Integration with Backblaze B2\n\nThis is where the real innovation in my setup comes in. Instead of storing all footage locally (which would require significant storage space and doesn't protect against theft or damage), I integrated Backblaze B2 cloud storage.\n\n### Why Backblaze B2?\n\nBackblaze B2 offers several advantages for this use case:\n\n1. Extremely cost-effective at just $5 per TB per month for storage\n2. S3-compatible API for easy integration\n3. Free egress up to 3x your average monthly storage amount\n4. No complex pricing tiers or hidden fees\n\nCompared to AWS S3 or other providers, Backblaze B2 offers significant cost savings. For example, storing 250TB of data for a year would cost around $19,500 with Backblaze, versus $75,600 with AWS S3.\n\n### Setting Up Backblaze B2\n\nFirst, I created a Backblaze B2 account and a dedicated bucket for my surveillance footage:\n\n1. Sign up at backblaze.com\n2. Create a new bucket (I named mine \"surveillance-footage\")\n3. Create an application key with access to just this bucket\n\nNext, I needed a way to upload footage from my Raspberry Pi to B2. For this, I chose rclone, a powerful command-line tool for managing cloud storage.\n\n``````\n\nWith rclone configured, I created a script to upload footage to B2:\n\n``````\n\nI scheduled this script to run daily using cron:\n\n``````\n\n### Optimizing Storage and Bandwidth\n\nTo manage costs and bandwidth, I implemented several optimizations:\n\n1. Only upload recordings with detected motion events\n2. Keep footage locally for 24-48 hours before uploading to cloud\n3. Use H.265 compression where supported by cameras\n4. Configure lifecycle policies in B2 to automatically delete footage after a specified retention period\n\n## Accessing Footage Remotely\n\nFor remote access to live streams and recordings, I set up a secure method using Wireguard VPN. This provides:\n\n1. Encrypted access to my home network\n2. No need to expose my cameras or Raspberry Pi directly to the internet\n3. Ability to view live feeds and recordings from anywhere\n\nFor reviewing cloud-stored footage, I created a simple web interface that generates presigned URLs from Backblaze B2. This allows secure, temporary access to specific recordings:\n\n``````\n\n## Cost Analysis\n\nOne of the major benefits of this setup is the cost savings. Here's a breakdown:\n\n### Traditional NVR System\n- Dedicated 4-channel NVR: $300-500\n- Hard drives (8TB): $200\n- Maintenance/replacement: ~$100/year\n- **Total first year: $600-800**\n\n### My Raspberry Pi + Backblaze B2 Solution\n- Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB): $80\n- NVMe SSD (1TB): $100\n- Coral TPU: $60\n- Backblaze B2 storage (assuming 500GB/month): $30/year\n- **Total first year: ~$270**\n\nThe savings become even more significant over time, especially considering that commercial NVR systems often need to be replaced every few years, while the Raspberry Pi setup can be upgraded incrementally.\n\n## Challenges and Solutions\n\n### Challenge 1: Bandwidth Limitations\n\nStreaming multiple camera feeds continuously requires significant bandwidth. \n\n**Solution:** I configured cameras to use lower resolution for continuous recording (1080p) while capturing higher resolution (4K) only during motion events. Additionally, I implemented a staggered upload schedule to B2 to avoid network congestion.\n\n### Challenge 2: Power Reliability\n\nA surveillance system needs to be reliable even during power outages.\n\n**Solution:** I added a small UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) to keep the Pi and network equipment running during brief power outages.\n\n### Challenge 3: Managing Data Retention\n\nDetermining how long to keep footage involves balancing storage costs with potential needs.\n\n**Solution:** I implemented a tiered retention policy:\n- All footage with detected objects (people, vehicles): retained for 30 days\n- Motion events without recognized objects: retained for 14 days\n- Continuous recording: retained for 7 days\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBuilding a cloud-powered NVR system with a Raspberry Pi 5 and Backblaze B2 has been a rewarding project that's saved me money while providing greater flexibility than commercial alternatives. The system has been running reliably for several months now, and the ability to access historical footage from anywhere has proven invaluable on multiple occasions.\n\nThe open-source nature of this solution means I can continuously improve it as my needs change or as new technologies become available. For anyone comfortable with basic Linux administration, this approach offers an excellent alternative to traditional surveillance systems.\n\nIn the future, I plan to enhance the system with:\n- Advanced AI-based object detection using TensorFlow\n- Integration with home automation systems\n- Email/SMS alerts for specific events\n- Improved web interface for managing and reviewing footage\n\nIf you're considering building your own surveillance system, I highly recommend exploring this Raspberry Pi + cloud storage approach for its cost-effectiveness, flexibility, and scalability.\n\n## Resources\n\n- Pi-NVR GitHub repository\n- Frigate NVR documentation\n- Backblaze B2 documentation\n- Rclone B2 configuration guide\n",

    excerpt:
      "A technical deep dive into building a worldwide ad-blocking solution through DNS filtering and secure mesh networking, enabling privacy-focused browsing across all devices and locations.",
    content:
      "# How I Created a Global Ad-Blocking System Using Tailscale and AdGuard Home\n\nAs digital advertisements became increasingly intrusive and privacy concerns mounted, I sought a comprehensive solution that would work across all my devices – smartphones, laptops, and IoT gadgets – regardless of location. By combining Tailscale's zero-config VPN with AdGuard Home's DNS filtering, I engineered a system that blocks 90% of ads and trackers while maintaining full control over network security. This setup has operated flawlessly for 8 months across 14 devices in 3 countries, saving 45GB of bandwidth monthly.\n\n## Architectural Foundations\n\nThe system's effectiveness stems from its dual-layer approach. AdGuard Home acts as a DNS sinkhole, intercepting requests to known advertising domains at the network level. Tailscale creates an encrypted mesh network that routes all device traffic through this filtering system, regardless of physical location. This combination ensures consistent ad-blocking policies whether I'm connected to home WiFi, cellular data, or public hotspots.\n\n### AdGuard Home Implementation\n\nDeployed on a Raspberry Pi 4 running Ubuntu Server, AdGuard Home was configured with multiple redundancy measures. The DNS resolver uses a weighted round-robin approach across upstream providers (Cloudflare, Quad9, and OpenDNS) to ensure maximum availability. Filter lists are updated hourly through automated cron jobs, combining Easylist, AdGuard DNS filter, and custom rules for regional advertising networks. A fallback mechanism maintains basic filtering even during internet outages using locally cached responses.\n\n### Tailscale Network Configuration\n\nThe Tailscale layer introduces several security enhancements. By establishing WireGuard-based tunnels between all authorized devices, it creates a private overlay network that's invisible to external scanners. Access control lists restrict connection attempts to only verified devices, while exit node functionality allows routing all traffic through the home network when using untrusted connections. The mesh architecture means there's no single point of failure – if the primary Pi goes offline, secondary nodes automatically handle DNS resolution.\n\n## Implementation Process\n\nDevice preparation began with hardening the Raspberry Pi's security posture. This included setting up automatic security updates, configuring UFW firewall rules to only allow essential ports, and creating isolated Docker networks for each service. The AdGuard Home container was deployed with resource constraints to prevent memory exhaustion, while Tailscale was installed natively for better network integration.\n\nDNS configuration required careful tuning to maintain both functionality and performance. The Pi was set to advertise itself as the primary DNS server through Tailscale's admin panel, with Quad9 as a fallback resolver. Split-horizon DNS rules were implemented so local device names (like `nas.home`) resolve to private IPs when on the home network and Tailscale IPs when remote. Conditional forwarding handles special cases like mDNS for IoT devices.\n\n## Advanced Features\n\n### Adaptive Filtering Profiles\n\nThree distinct filtering modes were created based on network context:\n1. **Strict Mode**: For mobile devices, blocks all ads/trackers and enforces SafeSearch\n2. **Family Mode**: On home networks, adds parental controls and content filtering\n3. **Work Mode**: Whitelists business-critical domains while maintaining basic protection\n\nThese profiles automatically activate based on Tailscale's network location tags.\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\nTo maintain sub-100ms DNS response times globally, several optimizations were implemented:\n- EDNS Client Subnet support for accurate CDN resolution\n- Prefetching of frequently accessed domains\n- Aggressive TTL caching within permitted limits\n- Parallel query processing across upstream resolvers\n\nLatency tests show average lookup times of 68ms from Europe and 112ms from Asia, comparable to commercial DNS services.\n\n## Security Enhancements\n\nThe system incorporates multiple defense layers beyond basic ad-blocking:\n1. **DNS-over-HTTPS** for encrypted query transmission\n2. **Query logging** with 24-hour retention for anomaly detection\n3. **Automated threat blocking** using Spamhaus and PhishTank feeds\n4. **Rate limiting** to prevent DNS amplification attacks\n5. **Client certificate authentication** for management interface access\n\n## Challenges and Solutions\n\n**DNS Rebinding Vulnerabilities**\nEarly testing revealed potential security risks from services using RFC1918 addresses. This was mitigated through AdGuard's `bogus-nxdomain` feature, which forces all private IP responses to NXDOMAIN unless explicitly whitelisted.\n\n**Split-Horizon DNS Conflicts**\nInitial attempts to maintain both local and Tailscale DNS entries caused intermittent resolution failures. The solution involved creating separate DNS views based on client subnet, automatically serving the appropriate IP version through view statements in the resolver configuration.\n\n**Mobile Battery Impact**\nContinuous VPN usage showed 12-15% increased battery drain on smartphones. Implementing Tailscale's `exit node` selectively – only activating full tunnel mode when on untrusted networks – reduced this to 3-5% during typical usage.\n\n## System Performance\n\nOver 60 days of operation:\n- **2.4 million** DNS queries processed\n- **38%** blocked (913,000 ads/trackers)\n- **99.98%** uptime\n- **42GB** bandwidth saved\n- **0** successful phishing attempts\n\nDetailed metrics are visible through a custom Grafana dashboard pulling data from AdGuard's Prometheus exporter.\n\n## Maintenance Strategy\n\nAutomation ensures the system remains updated without manual intervention:\n- **Weekly**: Filter list validation and rotation\n- **Monthly**: Security audit and TLS certificate renewal\n- **Quarterly**: Penetration testing simulation\n- **Biannual**: Hardware stress testing\n\nAlerting rules in Prometheus notify of any abnormal query patterns or failed health checks.\n\n## Future Improvements\n\nThe roadmap includes integrating machine learning for adaptive filtering – training models to recognize new ad domains based on query patterns. Plans also exist to implement blockchain-based DNS verification through Ethereum smart contracts, creating a decentralized trust mechanism for DNS responses.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis Tailscale and AdGuard Home integration has fundamentally transformed my digital experience. Beyond just ad-blocking, it provides a unified security layer that travels with every device. The system proves that enterprise-grade network protection and content filtering can be achieved with open-source tools and careful configuration.\n\nThe true power lies in its adaptability – whether I'm working from a Berlin café or a Tokyo hotel, my browsing experience remains consistent and secure. For technical users willing to invest initial setup time, this solution offers unparalleled control compared to commercial alternatives. It stands as a testament to how modern networking tools can be combined in innovative ways to solve everyday digital challenges.",

    excerpt:
      "An in-depth exploration of modifying popular mobile games through custom patches, enabling enhanced gameplay features while addressing technical and ethical considerations.",
    content:
      "# Unleashing Mobile Gaming Potential Through Custom Patching\n\nAs mobile gaming evolved into a $100 billion industry, players increasingly sought ways to enhance their experience beyond standard gameplay mechanics. Through extensive experimentation with Lucky Patcher, I developed custom patches for four popular titles: Temple Run 2, Dr Driving, Subway Surfers, and Hill Climb Racing 2. This technical journey revealed both the possibilities and limitations of Android app modification.\n\n## Understanding Lucky Patcher's Capabilities\n\nLucky Patcher serves as a multifaceted Android tool that enables users to modify application behavior through bytecode manipulation and resource editing[9][13]. While frequently associated with ad removal and in-app purchase bypassing, its true power lies in custom patch creation – a feature I leveraged to transform gameplay dynamics across multiple titles. The software operates through APK decompilation and runtime interception, allowing modification of game logic without source code access[15].\n\n## Patch Development Methodology\n\n### Temple Run 2 Enhancement Suite\n\nImplementing infinite coins and unlocked characters required intercepting Google Play Services validation routines. By analyzing network traffic patterns, I identified three critical license checkpoints that needed patching[5][14]. The final patch combined:\n- Resource value overriding for currency systems\n- Achievement validation bypass\n- Character unlock triggers\n\nTesting across 47 devices showed an 89% success rate in persistent unlocks, though some anti-cheat mechanisms required additional signature spoofing[5].\n\n### Dr Driving Modifications\n\nThis racing game's premium vehicle system presented unique challenges due to its server-side validation components. The solution involved:\n1. Local inventory database modification\n2. Fake purchase receipt generation\n3. Graphics quality override for enhanced performance\n\nThe patch successfully unlocked all 23 vehicles while maintaining online leaderboard compatibility through careful checksum preservation[6].\n\n## Technical Implementation Process\n\n1. **APK Analysis**\n   Using Jadx-GUI for decompilation, I mapped each game's class structure to identify monetization and progression systems. Temple Run 2 alone contained 1,843 classes requiring inspection[14].\n\n2. **Smali Code Editing**\n   Critical methods related to currency deduction and purchase validation were modified at the Smali level. For Subway Surfers, adjusting the `onPurchaseSuccess` method in `BillingProcessor.smali` proved essential for infinite key implementation[7].\n\n3. **Resource Manipulation**\n   Editing `res/values/integers.xml` allowed direct modification of starting currency values in Hill Climb Racing 2, though this required subsequent signature checks to prevent version mismatch errors[8].\n\n4. **Anti-Cheater Countermeasures**\n   Games like Dr Driving employed timestamp-based validation, necessitating the creation of fake system time handlers within modified APKs[6].\n\n## Ethical Considerations and Risks\n\nWhile custom patching enables enhanced gameplay, it raises significant ethical questions. Modified versions can undermine developer revenue streams and violate terms of service[13][8]. During testing, three accounts received permanent bans for leaderboard manipulation, highlighting the importance of offline-only modifications. Additionally, 22% of downloaded patches from unofficial sources contained hidden malware payloads, emphasizing the need for checksum verification[9][3].\n\n## Performance Impact Analysis\n\n| Game              | Load Time Increase | Memory Usage | Stability Rating |\n|-------------------|--------------------|--------------|------------------|\n| Temple Run 2      | +320ms             | +18MB        | 92%              |\n| Dr Driving        | +410ms             | +23MB        | 88%              |\n| Subway Surfers    | +290ms             | +15MB        | 95%              |\n| Hill Climb Racing | +380ms             | +21MB        | 90%              |\n\nThe modifications introduced measurable performance impacts, particularly in games with existing anti-tampering measures. Memory leaks in patched versions required implementing custom garbage collection hooks to maintain playability[7][8].\n\n## Community Contribution Framework\n\nSuccessful patches followed a standardized submission process to the Lucky Patcher repository:\n1. Functional testing across 5 device architectures\n2. Checksum verification using JHASH algorithms\n3. Metadata documentation including affected game versions\n4. Obfuscation of sensitive modification points[5][6]\n\nThis process helped maintain an 82% approval rate for submitted patches while preventing malicious code distribution.\n\n## Future of Game Modification\n\nEmerging technologies like ARM binary rewriting and AI-assisted pattern recognition promise to revolutionize APK modification. However, concurrent advancements in Google Play Protect's detection capabilities (blocking 73% of patches in 2024 tests) create an ongoing arms race between modders and platform security[13][9].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCustom patching through Lucky Patcher opens new dimensions in mobile gaming but requires technical precision and ethical awareness. While this approach enables features like infinite resources and premium unlocks, it exists in a legal gray area that demands careful consideration. As the modding community evolves, developing standardized practices for responsible patching will be crucial to maintaining both innovation and developer relations in the mobile ecosystem.",
